********************THIS IS SUBSTITUTION CIPHER**********************
used characters of ascii table from character 32 to 126....

created a constructor of all variables
		called methods newkey() and askQuestion() 

askquestion()
	a new character response is created
	response is automatically converting the entered letter/word(first letter) to upper case.

newKey()
	reset character to ' ' because it is going to change..
	clear the list to get rid of old key...
	clear the shuffledlist
	
	add all the characters we are considering to generate a key(from space to ~) in the list using for loop.
	initialise shuffled list as a new arraylist and pass list in it..
	then to shuffle the characters use Collections.shuffle(shuffledlist);
	hence a new key is generated....

getKey()
	using for each loop first display all characters of list
	using for each loop then display all characters of shuffledlist.
	
encrypt()
	create a string message that takes the input using scanner object
	now we will take the charArray letters that is already created and assign message to it and change the string message to charArray.
	we will check letter by letter 
	if the first letter is equal to any letter in the list then we replace the letter at an index i with the letter present at index i of shuffled list

decrypt()
	we will do exactly opposite as encrypt
	we will check if the letter is present in shuffled list
	then we will print the letter of the list at index i with respect to that of the shuffled list..		

 
concept:
we are taking the letters from ascii table then storing it in an arraylist named list.
then we are storing the same letters in shuffled list and using a shuffle function are shuffling them.
then we  are seing the letter from the list and comparing it with the generated key i.e the shuffled list.
then we are outputing the shuffled list character that is present at the same index as the intended letter in the list.
this is for encryption

and then we do the opposite for decryption ..
